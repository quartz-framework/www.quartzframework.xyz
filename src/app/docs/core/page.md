Quartz Core is the heart of the Quartz Framework — a lightweight, platform-agnostic, modular foundation that provides the essential infrastructure for building robust and maintainable Minecraft systems.

It is responsible for:

- Dependency Injection and lifecycle management

- Bean discovery, scopes, and configuration

- Context bootstrapping and lifecycle phases

Whether you're developing a plugin for any supported platform or even building your own extensions, Quartz Core handles the boilerplate so you can focus on your logic.

If you're familiar with Spring-like patterns, Quartz will feel intuitive — but without the weight or complexity.

Most features of Quartz Core are annotation-based and require no external configuration.
